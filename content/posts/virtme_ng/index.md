This article describes how to use virtme-ng for Linux kernel development.
<!--more-->

## Overview
Being able to quickly start a virtualized Linux Kernel on your development
machine is very valueable. It can speed up the development time considerably.

## Previous solutions
In the past there has been [virtme](https://github.com/amluto/virtme), which
has orginally been developed by Andrew Lutomirski. However this github repository
is no longer maintained and no longer works with current kernels.

The repository has been [forked](https://github.com/arighi/virtme) by Andea Righi.
However this fork is also no longer maintained. Andrea has created
[virtme-ng](https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng) for all new development.

## Installation from binary
Until a few months ago only installation from source was possible. However Arch
Linux, Debian and Ubuntu now offer packages. This makes the installation easier.

On Arch Linux the package can now be installed with:
```shell
sudo pacman -S virtme-ng
```

## Installation from source
The github repository does a good job for explaining how to install the software.
However for Arch Linux a few additional steps are required. Additional packages
are needed

```shell
sudo pacman -S virtiofsd
sudo pacman -S busybox
sudo pacman -S mkinitcpio-busybox
```
Install the repository:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng.git
```

On modern python installations the software can't be installed as described. Instead
an additional parameter needs to be specified:


```shell
cd <virtme-ng repository>
BUILD_VIRTME_NG_INIT=1 pip3 install --break-system-packages --verbose -r requirements.txt .
```

This installs the binaries under $HOME/.local/bin. Its best to exit session and start
a new session so the new binaries are added to the path.

## Usage
The github page describes its usage very well.

### Build
Switch to your linux kernel tree and build a new kernel with:

```shell
vng --build
```

### Run
Now you are able to run it:

```shell
vng --run
```

The result is a booted kernel:

```shell

(CTRL+d to exit)

```

### Run with boot parameters
Kernel boot parameters can be specified with -a (append) flag. The following example
specifies log_level boot parameter

```shell
‚ï≠‚îÄshr@shr in repo: linux on Ôêò shr/rel-v6.9 [$] took 1ms
‚ï∞‚îÄŒª vng -a loglevel=2 -v

```
From the dump boot command line parameters it is clear that the log_level boot parameter
has been set to 2.

This can also be verified with the following command:

```shell
‚ï≠‚îÄshr@virtme in repo: linux on Ôêò shr/rel-v6.9 [$] as üßô took 19ms
‚ï∞‚îÄŒª cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk

```

## Differences
Notable differences to virtme:
- Booting the kernel is very fast
- Kernel log is not displayed by default

To display the kernel log, the kernel can be started with:

```shell
vng -v
```
